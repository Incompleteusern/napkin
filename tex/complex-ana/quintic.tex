\chapter{Bonus: Topological Abel-Ruffini Theorem}

We've already shown the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
Now, with our earlier intuition on holomorphic $n$th roots,
we can now show that there is no general formula for 
the roots of a quintic polynomial.

\section{The Game Plan}

Firstly, what do we even mean by ``formula'' here?

\begin{definition}
    A \vocab{quintic formula} would be a formula taking in the coefficients $(a, \dots, f)$ of a 
    degree $5$ polynomial $P$, using the operations $+, -, \times, \div, \sqrt[n]{}$ 
    finitely many times, that maps to the five roots $(z_1, \dots, z_5)$ of $P$.
\end{definition}

Now, any proposed quintic formula $F$ receives the same coefficients when the roots are the same,
and thus gives the same output. This is fine at first glance, but swapping two roots continuously 
might pose more issues. $F$ must create and preserved the order of the roots under these permutations.

\begin{ques}
    Convince yourself this is true.
\end{ques}

\begin{remark}
    This isn't true if we bring even more complicated functions 
    such as \vocab{Bring Radicals} to the table. 
    But this wasn't really considered ``fair game.''
\end{remark}

\section{Step 1: The Simplest Case}

Let's first ignore the $\sqrt[n]{}$ operator for motivation.
Suppose I told you that some rational function $R$ always finds 
a root of a quintic polynomial $P(z) = (z - z_1)(z - z_2)(z - z_3)(z - z_4)(z - z_5)$.
For simplicitly let all the roots be distinct.

Suppose its initially equal to $z_1$. Now, suppose we smoothly swap the roots $z_1$ and $z_2$ 
along two paths that doesn't go through other roots. 

\begin{center}
	%% First Diagram
	\begin{asy}
		size(7cm);
		cplane();
		pair T;
		pair[] A = new pair[5];

		real r = 1.44;
		real[] dirs = {25,120,155,215,325};
		real[] mag = {1.5,1.9,1.25,0.9,1.8};
		for (int i=0; i<5; ++i) {
			A[i] = mag[i]*dir(dirs[i]);
			if (i < 2) {
			    dot("$z_{" + (string) (i+1) + "}$", A[i], dir(dirs[i]), red);
			}
			else {
				dot("$z_{" + (string) (i+1) + "}$", A[i], dir(dirs[i]), blue);
			}
		}
		draw(A[0]..(0.8*A[0]+0.6*A[1])..A[1], red, EndArrow);
		draw(A[1]..(0.2*A[0]+0.4*A[1])..A[0], red, EndArrow);
	\end{asy}
\end{center}


Since $R$ is continuous, it must be tracking the same root. However, once we finish 
swapping $z_1$ and $z_2$, the coefficients of $P$ are the same as they were initially.
But this means that $R$ has been tricked into changing the root it outputs, contradiction!

The bigger picture here is that we were able to find an operation that fixes $R$ while changing the order 
of the roots in $S_5$.

\section{Step 2: Nested Roots}

Once we add $\sqrt[n]{}$ back to the picture, this arguement doesn't immediately work.

\begin{example}[Quadratic Formula]
    If you've done any competition math, you know that for a polynomial 
    $P(z) = az^2 + bz + c = (z-z_1)(z - z_2)$, it follows that the two branches of
    \[
        \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
    \]
    give $z_1$ and $z_2$.

    So why can't swapping $z_1$ and $z_2$ yield a contradiction here?
    It's because while all the coefficients end up in the starting position,
    the liftings of how $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ travels may not.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Consider the polynomial $z^2 - 1$. Then smoothily swap the roots along
    $(z - e^{it})(z + e^{it})$. See that the two roots given by the quadratic formula
    also swap position.
\end{exercise}

Let's now consider the next simplest case of the $n$th root of a rational function
$\sqrt[n]{R}$, and try to fix it with a nontrivial permutation of the roots.

Swapping the roots $z_1$ and $z_2$, we keep $R$ the same, but $R$'s path $\alpha$ around 
the origin may have accumulated some change in phase $2\pi a$. If we were to unswap 
$z_1$ and $z_2$ in the same manner, we'd undo the change in phase, but we'd also be back
to doing nothing.

However, while changes in phase are \emph{abelian}, while permutations are not. Let's consider
another operation of swapping the roots $z_2$ and $z_3$. Taking a commutator of the two 
operations, we keep all the phases the same, but end up with a permutation 
$(12)(23)(12)^{-1}(23)^{-1}$.

If we mark the second operation's path with $\beta$, this corresponds to 
$\alpha\beta\alpha^{-1}\beta^{-1}$.

\begin{center}
	\begin{asy}
		unitsize(0.8cm);
		size(7cm);
		cplane();
		pair A = Drawing((1.5,0));
		dot("$R$", A, dir(-45));
		draw(A..(0,2.5)..MP("\alpha", (-1.5,2), dir(90))..(-1.2,-1.3)..(1,1.5)..(1.8,1.1)..A, red, EndArrow);
		draw(A..(0.7,0.5)..MP("\beta", (0.6,0.3), dir(90))..A, blue, EndArrow);
	\end{asy}
\end{center}


\begin{exercise}
    Show that this permutation operation is nontrivial.
\end{exercise}

We now have better tools: We have permutations in $S_5$ that fix the 
$n$th roots of rational functions, and their compositions under 
$+, -, \times, \div$.

How do we handle the nested radicals now?

\begin{example}[Cubic Formula]
    The cubic formula contains a nasty term
    \[
        \sqrt[3]{\frac{2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d + \sqrt{(2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^d)^2 - 4(b^3 - 3ac)^3}}{2}}.
    \]
    Here, we've taken multiple roots.
\end{example}

With our new tools, we can again consider their \emph{commutators}, which 
by the same logic as before fix all doubly nested radicals. Then, we can 
consider the commutators of commutators of commutators, and so on.

\section{Step 3: Normal Groups}

We've reduced this to a group theory problem.
Given a chain of commutators
\[
    S_5 = G \supseteq G^{(1)} \supseteq G^{(2)} \supseteq \dots
\]
where each group is the commutator subgroup of the next,
we want to show that $G^{(n)}$ never becomes trivial.
This chain is called the \vocab{derived series}.

\begin{exercise}
    Show that for the commutator subgroup $C$ of a group $G$, we have that $C \normalin G$,
    and that $G/C$ is Abelian.
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}
    A group $G$ is \vocab{solvable} if its derived series is nontrivial.
\end{definition}

So all that remains is showing that $S_5$ is not solvable.
We leave the housekeeping as an exercise.

\section{Summary}

While this is indeed a valid proof, it has some pros and cons. 
As a con, we haven't shown that any specific quintic polynomial 
has no solvable root (like the standard example $z^5 - z - 1$), only that 
it can't be consistent.

As a pro, this argument makes it very easy to add even more functions such 
as $\exp$ to the mix, and showing that even then no such formula exists.
